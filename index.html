    <b>THE BASICS OF THE WEB AND HTML</b>

    <p><em>1. Introduction to the Web</em></p>
    <p><b>World Wide Web</b> is a collection of HTML documents. 
    <p><b>HTML</b> stands for HyperText Markup Language, this is the basis for the majority of web pages. 
    <br>HTML is what connects most types of documents together through <em><b>hyperlinks</b></em>.
    <br>HTML can be made up of <em><b>text content</b> (what you see)</em>, <em><b>markup </b>(arrangement of content)</em>, <em><b>references to other documents</b></em>, <em><b>and links to other pages</b></em>.</p>
    <p><b>HTML markup</b> is made out of <em><b>tags</b></em>. A tag is formed by a <em>less than symbol</em>,<em> the tag name</em>, a <em>greater than symbol</em>, the tag <em>contents</em>, followed by a less than symbol, a <em>slash</em>, the tag name, and a greater than symbol.
    <br> The tag before the content is an <em>opening tag</em> and the one after is a <em>closing tag</em>. The whole structure is called an <em>element</em>.
    </p>

    <p><em>2. Computers are Stupid</em></p>
    <p>Programmers need to write in a language a computer understands; this way a computer can follow the instructions the programmer wrote.
    <br>Therefore, in order to be precised, it is imperative to use the right syntax. 
    </p>

    <p><em>3. HTML Attributes</em></p>
    <p><b>Anchor tags:</b> adds a link to a text or word. When clicked, it directs you to another page.
    <br><b>Image tags:</b> adds a link to an image. Another page is opened when the image is linked.
    <br><b>Whitespace:</b> text on multiple lines using the break tag <em>(void tag)</em> or the paragraph tag <em>(not a void tag)</em>.
    <br><b>Inline/Block:</b> an inline tag tells when a line ends, while a block tag creates an invisible box.
    <br>Examples of inline tags include the anchor, span, break, image, and strong tags. While the paragraph and div tags are types of block tags.</p>

    <p><em>4. Document Structure</em></p>
    <p>The basic structure of an HTML document includes: 
    <br>a DOCTYPE in the first line, 
    <br>an opening HTML tag on the second line, 
    <br>an opening and closing head tags, which will include title tags, 
    <br>an opening an closing body tags, which will include the page's content,
    <br>and a closing html tag.
    </p>
